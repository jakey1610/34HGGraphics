# Computer Graphics Assignment
## Instructions

## Features
I have modelled my own house in Durham. This included first making all of the relevant shape functions (box, sphere, etc), and then to more complex models (roof, windows, etc). There are a few animated models on the design including a bird, that I constructed myself from elementary 3D shapes, and a rat, amongst others which are detailed in the controls on the index.html file. For realism I have added textures to the roof, walls, and chimney of the house, and used appropriate colours elsewhere on the design. With regards to lighting I am using a combination of directional and ambient lighting to create the desired effect. Also, has a day/night cycle which can be animated by key hold.
